This is the source code for [Kulinda's Guild Wars 2 Mount Helper](https://kulinda.github.io/mounts/).

Feel free to play around, learn from it, change it. If you do make improvements, I'd appreciate a pull request.

## How to build

git clone

npm install

Some required files are not included in this repository.
* Put a 64x64 image into public/favicon.png (I'm using a random mount icon from the wiki)

after that, try npm start.
You need to know your way around react and create-react-app.
